# 🇵🇭 Wika: Philippine Language Learning Platform

**Learn the Filipino Languages!**  
**Explore, Connect, and Embody the Philippines with Wika.**

Wika is a modern web-based platform designed to help learners explore the diverse languages of the Philippines. Whether you're a student, educator, tourist, or someone wanting to connect with your cultural roots, Wika offers an accessible way to discover and practice various regional languages and dialects.

This project is currently being built by a **solo developer** and is an evolving initiative to preserve, promote, and celebrate the Philippines' linguistic heritage.

## ⚠️ Limitations
Because this project is built by one developer and Philippine linguistic data is not always well-documented:

- I cannot fully include *all* languages and dialects in the Philippines due to limited resources.  
- Some languages, especially lesser-known dialects, require **native speakers** for accurate verification.  
- Data availability varies per region, and some languages have no open datasets available.

## 📌 Assumptions & Use Cases
Wika is envisioned to be useful for a wide audience, including:

- **LGUs and academic institutions** for cultural and language education  
- **Students and educators** learning regional languages  
- **Tourists** wanting to better connect with local communities  
- **Families or partners** who want to learn each other's regional languages  
- **Anyone curious** about exploring the linguistic diversity of the Philippines
